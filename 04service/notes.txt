Services
Angular services are substitutable objects that are wired together using dependency injection (DI). You can use services to organize and share code across your app.

Angular services are:
1. Lazily instantiated – Angular only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.
2. Singletons – Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service factory.

Angular offers several useful services (like $http), but for most applications you'll also want to create your own.
