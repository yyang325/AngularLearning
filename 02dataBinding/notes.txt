Data-binding in Angular apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components. When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.

Angular templates work differently. First the template (which is the uncompiled HTML along with any additional markup or directives) is compiled on the browser. The compilation step produces a live view. Any changes to the view are immediately reflected in the model, and any changes in the model are propagated to the view. The model is the single-source-of-truth for the application state, greatly simplifying the programming model for the developer. You can think of
the view as simply an instant projection of your model.
